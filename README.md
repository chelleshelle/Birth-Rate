/* Under Construction */

This is my Time Series Analysis final project using R. The dataset used, Birth, is a compilation of total natality in the United States across 20 years (2003-2023) sourced and provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research https://data.nber.org/nvss/natality/csv/. NBER provides two types of dataset (“US” and “PS”), but I used “PS”, because “US” was too large for Excel to handle. I omitted almost all of the other variables for simplicity, then tabulated the monthly births using Excel. The user’s guide for each year can be found on CDC’s webpage https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm . 

Editor's note: This project has many flaws, but the visuals, mainly the time series model, ACFs and PACFs, forecast and spectral analysis are really cool!
