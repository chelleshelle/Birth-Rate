This dataset is a compilation of total natality in the United States across 20 years (2003-2023) sourced and provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research https://data.nber.org/nvss/natality/csv/. NBER provides two types of dataset (“US” and “PS”), but I used “PS”, because “US” was too large for Excel to handle. I omitted almost all of the other variables for simplicity (I might or might not refer to them in my report) and tabulated the monthly births using Excel. The user’s guide for each year can be found on CDC’s webpage https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm .
